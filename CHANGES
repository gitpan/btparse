Release 0.21 - 20 October, 1997
------------------------------
* added an Autoconf-generated 'configure' script to improve portability
  to (hopefully) any and all Unix-like systems
* overhauled all the Makefiles and header files to use the information
  provided by 'configure'
* fixed a bug in bt_parse_entry(): library crashed if it was called 
  twice after hitting eof; now just issues a warning
* fixed a bug in bt_split_list(): got confused if any sub-string save
  the first or last started with the first character of the delimiter 
  (thanks to Reiner Schlotte <schlotte@geo.palmod.uni-bremen.de> for
  reporting this)
* fixed to only warn about double quotes in strings if they're at "top
  level" (to avoid spurious warnings about, say, umlauts in German words --
  another bug reported by Reiner Schlotte)
* changed bt_cite_key() (in traversal.c) to bt_entry_key()
* fixed an over-enthusiastic sanity check in add_macro(): reported an
  internal error where there wasn't one whenever a macro value
  started with { or ", or ended with } or " (thanks to Dirk Vleugels
  <vleugels@do.isst.fhg.de> for reporting this)


Release 0.2 - 8 September, 1997
-------------------------------
* fixed several small memory leaks
* fixed postprocess_field() so it correctly returns empty string 
  (rather than NULL) if the field is just a single undefined macro
* totally overhauled the lexer parser (and, consequently, large parts of
  the whole library) to handle @comment and @preamble entries on equal
  footing with @string and @"anything-else"; made provisions for
  eventually handling @modify and @alias entries once BibTeX 1.0 is
  released and its behaviour known
* probably lots of other changes I've forgotten about


Release 0.1 - 8 March 1997
